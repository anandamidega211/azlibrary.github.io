    <h1>More about the site</h1>
    <p1>There can be a lot to take in. So if you'd like some personalized guidance,
         we recommend taking this 1-minute overview
         that will point you towards your genre (and subgenre).For an overview of all
          of the genres, that's what the rest of this post is for. There’s bound to 
          be a genre that’s the perfect fit for your book — all you have to do is 
          find it!</p1> 
    <h3>Science Fiction</h3>
     <p2>Though science fiction and fantasy are often considered two sides of the
         same (speculative fiction) coin, sci-fi is distinguished by its
          preoccupation with real or real-feeling science. Lots of sci-fi is set in
           the distant future, which makes it a seedbed for stories about time travel
            and space exploration. But your science fiction novel doesn’t need to be 
            inspired by “hard” science like physics and astronomy. Some of the books
             in this genre reflect on “soft” sciences, such as sociology and
              anthropology, to predict the future of the human race — more on
               that next!Book genres <br>

     <h3>Mystery</h3> 
     <p3>Also called detective fiction, this book genre is characterized by a 
        gripping plot that revolves around a mystery — but hopefully, you’ve cracked
         that clue! The setting, characters, and tone of your book will determine
          precisely which category it falls under: cozy mystery, hardboiled, or 
          something in between. But at the core of any mystery is a crime that must
           be solved by the protagonist. To get a sense of the clever trail of clues
            that’s so vital to this genre, check out Murder on the Orient Express by
             Agatha Christie — the grande dame of mystery fiction.<br>

     <h3>Fantasy</h3>
     <P4>This book genre is characterized by elements of magic or the supernatural 
        and is often inspired by mythology or folklore. In high fantasy — one that’s 
        set in an entirely fictional world — these magical elements are at the 
        forefront of the plot, as in Trudi Canavan’s Black Magician trilogy. 
        In low fantasy or magical realism, however, magic is subtly woven into an
         otherwise familiar, real-world setting. You can delve into fantasy’s many 
         subgenres to get to know your Arcanepunk from your Flintlock,
         and find your book’s home!<br>

     <h3>Romance</h3>
      <p5>Romance is so frequently used as a subplot that it can sometimes be tricky
         to know whether or not you’re writing in this genre. The key thing to 
         remember is that the romantic relationship must be the center point of
          the plot. (Other giveaways include a “happily ever after” ending and the
           warm fuzzies.) If your novel has a romantic relationship at its heart and
            is perfectly at home in another genre, it probably falls into one of 
            romance’s many subgenres, including but not limited to: 
        young adult romance, paranormal romance, and historical romance.<br><img src="https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/850/1000/xif0q/regionalbooks/a/n/j/the-fine-print-terms-and-conditions-the-final-offer-dreamland-original-imagn6r2xejz2k7w.jpeg?q=90" width=

        <h3>Thriller</h3>
        <p6>A horror story can also be called a thriller, if it employs psychological 
            fear to build suspense. But not all thrillers are horror stories. So what
             are they? While this book genre encompasses many of the same elements as 
             mystery, in a thriller the protagonist is usually acting to save their own
              life, rather than to solve the crime. Thrillers typically include
               cliffhangers, deception, high emotional stakes, and plenty of action —
            keeping the reader on the edge of their seat until the book’s climax. 
            Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl is a masterclass in the dark, mysterious thriller.<br><img src="https://macmillanlibrary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/silent-patient.png" width="1000" height="300"/><br><img src="https://mysterytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Best-Mystery-and-Thriller-book-covers-2017-mystery-tribune.png" width="700" height="300"/></p6>
            <h3>Horror</h3>
            <p7>What unites the books in this genre is not theme, plot, or setting, but the 
                feeling they inspire in the reader: your pulse quickens, and your skin
                 prickles as you turn the page with bated breath. Of course, this feeling 
                 of dread only comes about if the author creates the right atmosphere — an
                  essential feature dependent on the subgenre. Gothic horror, for example,
                   sends a shiver down your spine with spooky settings and paranormal 
                   elements, while gross-out horror shocks the reader with hacked-up flesh
                    and buckets of blood. The master of horror fiction in all its guises? Stephen King,
                     of course.<br><img src="https://miblart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/photo_2020-11-02_09-34-04.jpg"

                     <h3>True Crime</h3>
                     <p8>True Crime-fiction writers have put some pretty twisted plots to paper, but if 
                        you prefer to chronicle real crimes in all their haunting and fascinating
                         detail, then the true crime genre is where your book belongs. From infamous 
                         murders to domestic disappearances, works in this genre pen true stories,
                          about all things fearful and forbidden, that
                         read as smoothly as well-crafted fiction.<br><img src="https://celadonbooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/true-crime-1.jpg"

                         <h3>Children's Literature</h3>
                         <p9>As much as kids love fairytales and talking animals, they’re often just
                             as happy to pick up a nonfiction book at storytime. Whether it’s an activity 
                             book to keep them busy, a powerful true story like Malala’s Magic Pencil,
                              or a children’s encyclopedia to feed their brains, children’s nonfiction is
                               all about making learning fun. And the wildly popular Horrible Histories
                                series has proven that this genre can compete with wizards and superheroes
                                 at every age!<br><img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/fTYAAOSwNxNjECRH/s-l1600.jpg" width="1000" height="300"/><br><img src

                         <p10>  There you have it: 35 of the most popular genres of books. Hopefully, this 
                            list will help you get your foot in the right door. But if your book doesn’t
                             slot neatly into any of these categories (though there are quite some more
                              types of nonfiction to consider), don’t be afraid to declare it a hybrid,
                               or to dig a little deeper 
                            into the subcategories that you’ll find in the shade of these umbrella genres.<br><img src="https://st4.depositphotos.com/14768666/39686/v/600/depositphotos_396860776-stock-illustration-literary-genres-icons-set-flat.jpg" width="800" height="400"/></p10>
